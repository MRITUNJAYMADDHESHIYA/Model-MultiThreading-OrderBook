1. the goal is to allow dynamic dispatching of objects in two separate hierarchies of types. 


2.The problem solved by the visitor pattern is the application of dynamic rules to two 
or more polymorphic objects at the same time. This is necessary because C++, like some 
other object-oriented languages, uses single dispatch to process polymorphic calls.
