//Structural(7 types):- class, interface, component, package, object, node, deployment
//Behavioral(7 types):- Sequence, activity, use case, state machine, communication, timing, interaction overview
//Architectural(4 types):- composite structure, profile, information flow, interaction overview

//class diagram:- Describes the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, operations, and relationships among objects.

//Association:- class association ->Inheritance
//           :- object association ->simple(one object-->one object), aggregation(one object-->many objects), composition(one object --> parts on its own)

//sequence diagram:- Interaction between objects in a time sequence.

/////////////Example of ATM machine/////////////  
//1-:- user(account no. + amount )-->atm
//2-:- atm --> transaction-->(verify pin, check balance, withdraw cash, deposit cash)
//3-:- 

//use case
//objects ->(atm, user, transaction, account, cash dispensor)
