//The common point between a mutex and a semaphore is that both are synchronization primitives used in concurrent programming to manage access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.



//mutex:-
//1.only one thread
//2.locked/unlocked
//3.locking mechanism
//4.one thread at a one time






//semaphore:-
//1.collection of thread
//2.count
//3.singaling (notify the other for do your work)
//4.multiple buffer then multiple thread can access the same time
