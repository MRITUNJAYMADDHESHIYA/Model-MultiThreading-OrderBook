1.Latency Equation:-
    Latency = Time of Order Placement - Time of Order Execution


2.Levels of Low Latency in HFT Framework:-
Microseconds (µs):
    HFT systems strive to execute orders within microseconds, which are one-millionth of a second.
    Latency at this level allows traders to react to market events faster than human perception.
Nanoseconds (ns):
    Some HFT strategies aim for latencies in the nanosecond range, which are one billionth of a second.
    Achieving nanosecond-level latency is made possible through advanced technologies like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and custom hardware.
Picoseconds (ps):
    In the quest for the fastest possible execution, a few ultra-high-frequency trading strategies work at the picosecond level, which is one trillionth of a second.
    Achieving picosecond-level latency is exceptionally challenging and requires cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure.


3.Strategies for Minimizing Latency:-
a-->Direct Market Access (DMA):
        DMA allows traders to connect directly to an exchange’s trading infrastructure, bypassing intermediaries such as brokers or market makers.
b-->FPGA Technology (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays):
        FPGAs are hardware components that can be programmed to perform specific tasks with extremely low latency.
        FPGAs offer ultra-low latency for critical trading functions, such as order book processing and order execution.
