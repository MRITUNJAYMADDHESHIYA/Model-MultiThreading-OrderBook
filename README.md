1.Task folder(and apply pair trading strategy for MFT in nifty and banknifty)
//1. base.ipynb
// ########### Pair Trading Strategy Class(some modification in zscore strategy then better perform) ##########
// ########### 1.Modified exit logic to exit at mid-point of bands (midpoint should be dynamic, in this case (Upper+Lower)/2 But if I want for Better exit then I can do = spread mean, or Z=0. )
// ########### 2.Added stop-loss based on implied volatility levels
