/////HFT strategy:-
Low- Latency network + Powerful Hardware + Mathematical Model + Exchange data centre
Strategy:-
1.Market Making:-        Medium Speed       profit(bid-ask spread) - provide liquidity
2.Arbitrage:-            Ultra-fast         profit(one stock on different exchange)(eg..cash-future arbitrage, spatial arbitrage, triangular arbitrage in forex)
3.Latency Arbitrage:-    ultra-fast         profit(price delay on one exchange to other exchange)
4.Statistical Arbitrage:-fast               Pair trading(Two stocks but correlated assets, buy one and sell other)
5.Order Anticipation:-   ultra-fast         Big Institutional orders(placed in smaller chunks + Manipulation) Order flow + footprint chart + volume on price + heatmaps(level II)

6.Iceberg:-              Real time          Traders can identify these hidden orders by observing repeated, large-volume executions at the same price, suggesting an iceberg order is absorbing trades. Analyzing trade execution patterns, volume profiles, and order book behavior can reveal the presence of these hidden orders. 
7.Quote stuffing:-       ultra-fast         Quote stuffing is the practice where a large number of orders to buy or sell securities are placed and then canceled almost immediately
8.Order Book Imbalance:- Real-time
